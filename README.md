# Space_Ace

This is a course project developed for the Nintendo 64 using the N64SDKmod toolchain by github.com/CrashOverride99

The project was developed by Timothy Finnegan at the University of Nevada, Reno in Fall 2020.

The Project is developed entirely in C, and implements many basic game systems from scratch.

It was originally slated to be a space-based flight simulator, but time and hardware constraints
lead to it being repurposed into a simple survival game.

This has only been tested on actual N64 hardware and is not guaranteed to work in an emulator. You must have an N64 flash cart to play.

To Build:

1. Install n64sdkmod in Docker (github.com/CrashOverride99)
2. Run "Make" in the .../Space_Ace Directory
